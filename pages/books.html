    <h1>Books and Comic Books</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Favorite book series:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</h3>
          <p>
            I read these books, when I was much younger,<br>
            but I always think back about these fondly.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Dune</h3>
          <p>
            I read these books quite recently,<br>
            before the Dune movie came out and<br>
            to be honest I love both of them.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Agatha Christie, crime books</h3>
          <p>
            I read these books constantly,<br>
            whenever I find a new one I buy it and read it.
          </p>

      <h2>Favorite comic books:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Invincible</h3>
          <p>
            I fortunately read these, way before<br>
            the series came out, because after it did,<br>
            the price of the comic went up, I love it<br>
            mainly because it is easy to follow<br>
            and you cannot get lost like in Marvel <br>
            or DC comics with the lots of various <br>
            universes and storylines.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Flash</h3>
          <p>
            I love the flash ever since I was <br>
            10 years old, because I got an action <br>
            figure from my parents. Since then <br>
            I learned to speak english, just so <br>
            I can read Flash comics. I can thank <br>
            a lot to flash.
