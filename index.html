      Hey my name is <strong>Benjamin Nyikos</strong>, but just call me Ben,
      <br>
      I am originally from Hungary, but at the moment I am studying <br>
      in Antwerpen, Belgium at the KDG university. My Bachelor <br>
      is Multimedia and Creative Technologies. <br>
      I love to take challanges, that is why I applied to this <br>
      course. Also it is really hard to find any internship with <br>
      no proof about any prior experience in anything computer related. <br>
      Under you can find my HTML only offline website.
